# EhsanVoice
The focus of this app is to help people with speech difficulties. It lets you record commonly used phrases in the voices you love the most --your voice or in friends' or family.  The usual text to speech is very robotic and does not include expressions, of course. So with this app, record in the voice you like and play back each message on demand any time!

Any number of messages can be recorded with helpful tips typed in any language. The messages can be grouped into categories for easy access; and the order in which messages appear in the list can be changed as well. Messages categories can be changed as well. New categories can be added and all existing ones are configurable. 

And just to compliment, it does provide the feature of text to speech as well, and automatically saves the newly typed sentences into its dictionary in order to provide helpful suggestions when typing similar text, the next time. It will help the user to type partial text and select from the tip provided instead of typing the whole sentence.
